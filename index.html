        <p><b>A Revitalization Effort</b></p>

    <!-- The Purpose Section -->
    <div class="info_section">
      <h2>OUR GOAL</h2>
      <p>There are fewer than 10 living first-language speakers of Gayogo&#817;ho:n&#491;&#704;, 
        and that number continues to decline. We want to change that. Our mission 
        is to preserve and revitalize the Gayogo&#817;ho:n&#491;&#704; language by making it more 
        accessible to learners, educators, and community members. Every language 
        carries with it a worldview, a way of understanding and expressing culture, 
        identity, and history. Revitalizing Gayogo&#817;ho:n&#491;&#704; is not just about saving words—
        it’s about preserving a way of life, reconnecting with ancestral knowledge, 
        and strengthening the cultural fabric of the Cayuga Nation.
      </p>
      <p>For centuries, Gayogo&#817;ho:n&#491;&#704; has been passed down through oral tradition, 
        carrying the wisdom, stories, and teachings of the Cayuga people. However, 
        due to historical displacement, forced assimilation policies, and the impact 
        of residential schools, the number of fluent speakers has dwindled. Without 
        active revitalization efforts, this language—along with its unique expressions 
        of culture—faces the risk of being lost. We refuse to let that happen. 
      </p>
      <p>The Cayuga Nation, one of the Six Nations of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, 
        originally resided on the land now occupied by Cornell University and surrounding 
        areas. The language and history of this land are deeply intertwined, and it is 
        crucial for students and the broader community to recognize and engage with this 
        legacy. Through our website, we aim to educate visitors on the historical 
        significance of Gayogo&#817;ho:n&#491;&#704; while also providing tools for learning and 
        exploration. 
      </p>
      <p>Our goal is to create a space where people can reconnect with the language, whether 
        they are descendants of Cayuga speakers, linguists, students, or anyone interested 
        in Indigenous language preservation. By combining technology, education, and cultural 
        resources, we hope to inspire a new generation of learners and speakers. Together, we 
        can ensure that Gayogo&#817;ho:n&#491;&#704; continues to be spoken, celebrated, and passed on for 
        generations to come.
