        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Our team came together with the goal of language preservation, recognizing the urgent need to document 
          and teach Gayogohó:nǫˀ before it is lost. What began as a small project among linguists, educators, and 
          community members quickly grew into a broader initiative aimed at making the language more accessible to 
          learners of all backgrounds.</p>
        <p>The history of the Gayogohó:nǫˀ language is deeply intertwined with the history of the Cayuga people, 
          who have faced displacement, forced assimilation, and the ongoing effects of colonization. For generations, 
          the language was passed down through oral tradition, but government policies such as residential schools 
          severely disrupted this transmission. Today, with fewer than ten living first-language speakers, the need 
          for revitalization is more urgent than ever.</p>
        <p>Despite these challenges, the resilience of the Cayuga people and their dedication to language preservation 
          continue to inspire our work. Through collaboration with Native speakers, linguists, and passionate advocates, 
          we strive to create a space where the language can thrive once more. This project is more than just a digital 
          resource—it is a living, evolving effort to ensure that future generations can speak, learn, and engage with 
          Gayogohó:nǫˀ.</p>

    <section class="approach">
        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>We believe that language revitalization requires a multifaceted approach that 
          combines digital tools, educational resources, and community engagement. Our project 
          is guided by the following core principles:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Accessibility Through Technology</b><br>
            By leveraging modern technology, we aim to make Gayogohó:nǫˀ more accessible to a broad 
            audience. Our online dictionary, pronunciation guides, and learning resources provide 
            users with the tools they need to explore the language at their own pace. We also 
            recognize that many Indigenous communities face barriers to internet access, so we are 
            committed to making our materials available in multiple formats.
          </li><br>
          <li>
            <b>Community-Driven Revitalization</b><br>
            Language belongs to the people who speak it, and any revitalization effort must be rooted 
            in the community. We work closely with fluent speakers, cultural leaders, and educators 
            to ensure that our materials accurately reflect the language as it is spoken and understood. 
            Our project is not just about documentation—it is about fostering connections between learners 
            and speakers.
          </li><br>
          <li>
            <b>Education & Outreach</b><br>
            Revitalizing a language goes beyond vocabulary; it involves understanding the culture, history, 
            and traditions embedded within it. We provide historical context, grammar explanations, and 
            cultural insights to help learners engage with the language on a deeper level. We also collaborate 
            with schools, universities, and Indigenous organizations to integrate Gayogohó:nǫˀ into educational 
            curricula.
          </li><br>
          <li>
            <b>Sustainability & Growth</b><br>
            Language revitalization is a long-term effort, and sustainability is key. We are committed to 
            continually updating and expanding our resources, training new language teachers, and developing 
            initiatives that will support the next generation of speakers. Our goal is to create a self-sustaining 
            ecosystem of learning that will keep the language alive for years to come.
